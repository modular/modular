# Welcome to Modular Platform

> Note: Mojo is included as a subdirectory in this repository

The Modular Platform is an open and fully-integrated suite of AI libraries
and tools that accelerates model serving and scales GenAI deployments. It
abstracts away hardware complexity so you can run the most popular open
models with industry-leading GPU and CPU performance without any code changes.

[See here to get started with the Modular platform](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started)
and when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/new/choose).

The [Discord](https://discord.gg/modular) community and
[our forum](https://forum.modular.com/) is the best place to share
your experiences and chat with the team and other community members.

In the [examples directory](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/examples),
you will find code examples and Jupyter notebooks that show how to run inference
with Modular platform.

## Getting Started

Modular platform is available in both stable and nightly builds. To install
either version, follow the guide to [create a project with
Magic](https://docs.modular.com/max/create-project).

Then clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modular/modular.git
```

If you installed the [stable
release](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages#stable-release), be sure you
switch to the `stable` branch, because the `main` branch is for nightly
releases and might not be compatible with stable builds:

```bash
git checkout stable
```

## Running

### Pipelines

To show off the full power of Modular platform, a
[series of end-to-end pipelines for common AI workloads](./max/pipelines/)
(and more) are ready to run. As one example, this includes everything needed to
self-host
[the Llama 3.1 text-generation model](./max/pipelines/architectures/llama3/).
All code is provided so that these pipelines can be customized, built upon, or
learned from.

### Examples

In addition to the end-to-end pipelines, there are many [examples](./examples/)
that exercise various aspects of Modular platform. You can follow the
instructions in the README for each example or notebook you want to run.

### Tutorials

The [tutorials](./tutorials/) directory contains the "finished" code for
tutorials you can read at
[docs.modular.com/max/tutorials](https://docs.modular.com/max/tutorials).

### Docker Container

The MAX container is our official Docker container for convenient deployment.
It includes the latest Modular platform version with GPU support, several AI
libraries, and integrates with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

The MAX container image is available in the
[Modular Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/modular/max-nvidia-base/).
