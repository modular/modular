"""Provides layout and layout tensor types, which abstract memory layout for
multidimensional data.

- The [`Layout`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout) type represents a mapping
  between a set of logical coordinates and a linear index. It can be used, for
  example, to map logical tensor coordinates to a memory address, or to map GPU
  threads to tiles of data.

- The [`LayoutTensor`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout_tensor/LayoutTensor) type is a
  high-performance tensor with explicit memory layout via a `Layout`.
