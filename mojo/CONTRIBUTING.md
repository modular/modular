# Mojo contributor guide

Welcome to the Mojo community! üî• We‚Äôre very excited that you‚Äôre interested in
contributing to the project. To help you get started and ensure a smooth
process, we‚Äôve put together this contributor guide.

There are many ways to contribute to the project, from joining the
[Discord community](https://www.discord.gg/modular), to filing bugs, to
contributing documentation, examples, or code.

## Contributing to the standard library

To ensure a streamlined process, contributors are encouraged to focus on
enhancements, bug fixes, and optimizations aligned with the library's
overarching goals. These guidelines aim to facilitate a collaborative
environment where contributors and the standard library team can work together
effectively toward the continued improvement of Mojo.

For more information on our priorities, see the following documents:

- Our [Vision document](./stdlib/docs/vision.md) describes the guiding
  principles behind our development efforts.
- Our [Roadmap](./stdlib/docs/roadmap.md) identifies concrete development goals
  as we work towards an even more robust and feature-rich standard library.

For technical details on developing for the standard library, see the following
documents:

- [Developing the standard library](./stdlib/docs/development.md) covers building,
  testing, and other information you‚Äôll need to work in the standard library.
- [Coding Standards and Style Guide](./stdlib/docs/style-guide.md) provides
  guidelines for writing code for the standard library.

### Changes we *accept*

These changes are uncontroversial, easier to review, and more likely to be
accepted:

- Well-documented bug fixes submitted with code reproducing the issue in a test
  or benchmark.
- Performance improvements that don‚Äôt sacrifice code readability or
  maintainability and are accompanied by benchmarks.
- Improvements to stdlib documentation or that expand on it.
- Improvements to the test coverage.
- Porting of tests from `FileCheck` to using `assert_*` functions from the
  `testing` module.
- Changes that address security vulnerabilities.

If you‚Äôre interested in making a more significant change, we ask that you first
go through our [proposal process](#proposals).

### Changes we *avoid*

Changes that don‚Äôt align with our vision and roadmap are unlikely to be
accepted. For example:

- Changes that do not align with the published roadmap or the core principles of
  the standard library.
- Changes to the math module until more thorough performance
  benchmarking is available.
- Code without tests‚Äîespecially for core primitives.
- Changes that break existing API or implicit behavior semantics.
- Changes where the contributors‚Äô favorite feature or system isn‚Äôt being used
  and they submit a change unilaterally switching the project to use it. For
  example, the contributor doesn‚Äôt like CMake as a build system and submits a PR
  changing the repository to use their favorite build system.
- Adding support for esoteric platforms.
- Adding dependencies to the code base.
- Broad formatting or refactoring changes.
- Changes that need broad community consensus.
- Changes if contributors are not responsive.
- Adding an entire new module without going through the RFC/proposal process.

## About pull request sizes

We ask that contributors make pull requests as small as possible. When
you are opening a pull request, check the number of lines modified in GitHub.
The smaller the better (but don't exclude the tests or docstrings). If your
pull request is over 100 lines, please try to split it into multiple pull
requests. If you make them independent, it's even better as no synchronization
will be needed for the merge.

This guideline is here for the following reasons:

- **Higher quality reviews**: It is much easier to spot a bug in a few lines
than in 1000 lines.
- **Faster overall review**: Reviewers, to approve a pull request, need to
understand every line and understand how it fits into your overall change.
They also need to go back and forth between files and functions to understand
the flow of the code. This is exponentially hard as there are more lines in the code.
- **Avoiding blocking changes that are valid**: In a huge pull request, it's
likely that some changes are valid and some need to be reworked/discussed. If all
the changes are in the same pull request, then the valid changes will be blocked
until all discussions have been resolved.
- **Reducing the number of git conflicts**: Bigger pull request means slower reviews,
thus means that the pull request will be open longer and will have more git conflicts
to be resolved before being merged.
- **Parallel processing**: All programmers like to parallelize. Well, reviewers also
like to parallelize code reviews to merge your code faster. If you open two pull
requests that are independent, then two reviewers will be able to work on your
code.
- **Finding the time for a code review**: Doing a code review often requires
that the code is reviewed in one go, as it's hard to remember functions and code
logic from one review session to another. Thus a big pull request will require
the reviewer to allocate a big chunk of time to do the code review, which is not
always possible and might delay the review and merge of your pull request
for multiple days.

Smaller pull requests means less work for the maintainers and faster reviews
and merges for the contributors. It's a win-win!

## Proposals

If you‚Äôre interested in making a significant change‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt fall into
the list of ‚ÄúChanges we accept,‚Äù your first step is a written proposal. The
proposals process ensures feedback from the widest possible set of community
members and serves as an audit log of past proposal changes with most
importantly the rationale behind it.

Proposals consist of a GitHub [Pull Request](#pull-requests) that adds a
document to the¬†[`proposals/`](./proposals)¬†directory. Contributors are
encouraged to react with a¬†*thumbs-up*¬†to proposal PRs if they are generally
interested and supportive of the high-level direction. These are assigned to
Mojo standard library leads to decide. The proposal PR can be merged once the
assigned lead approves, all blocking issues have been decided, and any related
decisions are incorporated. If the leads choose to defer or reject the proposal,
the reviewing lead should explain why and close the PR.

This process is heavily inspired by the process used by several other
open-source projects. We‚Äôll add more documentation in the future as we gain
experience with the process.
