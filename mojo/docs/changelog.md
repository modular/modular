# Mojo unreleased changelog

This is a list of UNRELEASED changes for the Mojo language and tools.

When we cut a release, these notes move to `changelog-released.md` and that's
what we publish.

### ‚ú® Highlights

### Language enhancements {#25-7-language-enhancements}

- Literals now have a default type. For example, you can now bind `[1,2,3]` to
  `T` in a call to a function defined as `fn zip[T: Iterable](impl:T)` because
  it will default to the standard library's List type.

- Mojo now has a `__functions_in_module` experimental intrinsic that allows
  reflection over the functions declared in the module where it is called. For
  example:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(): pass

  def bar(x: Int): pass

  def main():
    alias funcs = __functions_in_module()
    # equivalent to:
    alias same_funcs = Tuple(foo, bar)
  ```

  The intrinsic is currently limited for use from within `main`.

- The `@implicit` decorator now accepts an optional `deprecated` keyword
  argument. This can be used to phase out implicit conversions instead of just
  removing the decorator (which can result in another, unintended implicit
  conversion path). For example, the compiler now warns about the following:

  ```mojo
  struct MyStuff:
    @implicit(deprecated=True)
    fn __init__(out self, value: Int):
      pass

  fn deprecated_implicit_conversion():
    # warning: deprecated implicit conversion from 'IntLiteral[1]' to 'MyStuff'
    _: MyStuff = 1

    _ = MyStuff(1)  # this is okay, because the conversion is already explicit.
  ```

- The `@deprecated` decorator can now take a target symbol with the `use` keyword
  argument. This is mutually exclusive with the existing positional string
  argument. A deprecation warning will be automatically generated.

  ```mojo
  @deprecated(use=new)
  fn old():
    pass

  fn new():
    pass

  fn main():
    old() # 'old' is deprecated, use 'new' instead
  ```

### Language changes {#25-7-language-changes}

- Expressions like `(Int, Float)` is no longer a syntax sugar for
  `Tuple[Int, Float]`. It instead creates a tuple instance of two type values,
  i.e., `(Int, Float) : Tuple[__typeof(Int), __typeof(Float)]`.

- The `__type_of` magic function has been been renamed to `type_of`. Using the
  old spelling will yield a deprecation warning. Similarly, `__origin_of` has
  been deprecated in favor of the new `origin_of`.

### Library changes {#25-7-library-changes}

- Added `os.isatty()` function to check whether a file descriptor refers to a
  terminal. This function accepts an `Int` file descriptor. If you have a
  `FileDescriptor` object, use its `isatty()` method instead.

- The `Hasher` trait's `_update_with_bytes` method now takes `Span[Byte]`
  instead of `UnsafePointer[UInt8]` and a separate length parameter. This
  change applies to all hasher implementations including `AHasher` and `Fnv1a`.

- Added `unsafe_get`, `unsafe_swap_elements` and `unsafe_subspan` to `Span`.

- The deprecated `DType.index` is now removed in favor of the `DType.int`.

- `math.isqrt` has been renamed to `rsqrt` since it performs reciprocal square
  root functionality.

- Added `swap_pointees` function to `UnsafePointer` as an alternative to `swap`
  when the pointers may potentially alias each other.

- `memcpy` and `parallel_memcpy` without keyword arguments are deprecated.

- The `math` package now has a mojo native implementation of `acos`, `asin`,
  `cbrt`, and `erfc`.

- Added support for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970.

- Added support for NVIDIA Jetson Thor.

- `Optional` now conforms to `Iterable` and `Iterator` acting as a collection of
  size 1 or 0.

- `origin_cast` for `LayoutTensor`, `NDBuffer` and `UnsafePointer` has been
  deprecated and removed. `LayoutTensor` and `NDBuffer` now supports a safer
  `as_any_origin()` origin casting. `UnsafePointer` has the same
  safe alternative and in addition, it has an additional safe `as_immutable`
  casting function and explicitly unsafe `unsafe_mut_cast` and
  `unsafe_origin_cast` casting function.

- The `@implicit` decorator on `UInt.__init__(Int)` has been deprecated.
  Conversion from `Int` to `UInt` should now be done explicitly using
  `UInt(int_value)`.

- `assert_equal` now displays colored character-by-character diffs when string
  comparisons fail, making it easier to spot differences. Differing characters
  are highlighted in red for the left string and green for the right string.

- Added `sys.compile.SanitizeAddress` providing a way for mojo code to detect
  `--sanitize address` at compile time.

- Error messages now preserve symbolic calls to `always_inline("builtin")`
  functions rather than inlining them into the error message.

### Tooling changes {#25-7-tooling-changes}

- `mojo test` has [been deprecated](https://forum.modular.com/t/proposal-deprecating-mojo-test/2371)
  and will be removed in a future release.

### ‚ùå Removed {#25-7-removed}

- `LayoutTensorBuild` type has been removed.  Use `LayoutTensor` with parameters
  directly instead.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed {#25-7-fixed}

- The `math.cos` and `math.sin` function can now be evaluated at compile time
  (fixes #5111).

- Fixed `IntTuple.value(i)` method returning incorrect values when elements are
  stored as nested single-element tuples. Previously, calling
  `Layout.row_major(M, N).stride.value(i)` would return negative offset values
  (e.g., -65536, -65537) instead of the actual stride values. This affected any
  code that accessed layout stride or shape values using the `value()` method.

- Fixed `LayoutTensor.shape[idx]()` method returning incorrect values for nested
  layouts. The bug occurred when accessing shape dimensions of tensors with
  nested layouts like `((32, 2), (32, 4))`, where the method would return
  garbage values instead of the correct product (e.g., 64).

  - Fixed `LayoutTensor` element-wise arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  between tensors with different memory layouts. Previously, operations like
  `a.transpose() - b` would produce incorrect results when the operands had
  different layouts, because the same layout index was incorrectly used for both
  operands. This now correctly computes separate indices for each tensor based
  on its layout.

- Fixed `LayoutTensor.shape[idx]()` method returning incorrect values for nested
  layouts. The bug occurred when accessing shape dimensions of tensors with
  nested layouts like `((32, 2), (32, 4))`, where the method would return
  garbage values instead of the correct product (e.g., 64).

- Fixed `arange()` function in `layout._fillers` to properly handle nested
  layout structures. Previously, the function would fail when filling
  tensors with nested layouts like
  `Layout(IntTuple(IntTuple(16, 8), IntTuple(32, 2)), ...)` because it
  attempted to extract shape values from nested tuples incorrectly.
