what we publish.

## UNRELEASED

### ‚ú® Highlights

### Language enhancements

- `@parameter for` now works on a broader range of collection types, enabling
  things like `@parameter for i in [1, 2, 3]: ...`.

### Language changes

- The `@value` decorator has been formally deprecated with a warning, it will
  be removed in the next release of Mojo.  Please move to the `@fieldwise_init`
  and synthesized `Copyable` and `Movable` trait conformance.

- Implicit trait conformance is removed. All conformances must be explicitly
  declared.

### Standard library changes

- Added support for a wider range of consumer-grade AMD hardware, including:
  - AMD Radeon RX 7xxx GPUs
  - AMD Radeon RX 9xxx GPUs
- Compile-time checks for AMD RDNA3+ GPUs are now provided by the functions:
  - `_is_amd_rdna3()`
  - `_is_amd_rdna4()`
  - `_is_amd_rdna()`
- Added WMMA matrix-multiplication instructions for RDNA3+ GPUs to help support
  running AI models on those GPUs.

- `memory.UnsafePointer` is now implicitly included in all mojo files. Moreover,
  `OpaquePointer` (the equivalent of a `void*` in C) is moved into the `memory`
  module, and is also implicitly included.

### Tooling changes

- Added progress reporting support to the Mojo language server. This will emit progress
  notifications in your editor when the server is currently parsing a document.

### ‚ùå Removed

- Various functions from the `sys.info` have been removed.  Use the appropriate method
  on `CompilationTarget` from `sys.info` instead.
  - `is_x86()`
  - `has_sse4()`

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [#4820](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/4820) - `math.exp2` picks
  the wrong implementation for `float64`.
