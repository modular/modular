This version is still a work in progress.

## Highlights

## Documentation

## Language enhancements

## Language changes

## Library changes

- `Int` is now an alias for `Scalar[DType.int]` and integer literals materialize
  to this `Scalar` type. Because of this some conversions have become more
  strict.

  A new `SIMDSize` type has been added for the width of `SIMD` itself and must
  be used when inferring a parameter based on a SIMD argument like so:

  ```mojo
  def frob[w: SIMDSize](v: SIMD[DType.int, w]): ...
  ```

  Alternitively the width can be unbound if you simply want to be parametric
  over any `SIMD` type:

  ```mojo
  def frob(v: SIMD[DType.int, _])
  ```

  The new `Int` should still be used in all other situations.

- `ImplicitlyDestructible` has been renamed to `ImplicitlyDeletable`, for better
  name consistency with its required `__del__()` "delete" special method.

## Tooling changes

- Added a `--lld-path` CLI flag. This overrides the LLD path that Mojo uses.

## GPU programming

- Added `warp.match_any()`, which returns, for each warp lane, the mask of
  lanes whose value has the same bits. It uses NVIDIA's `match.any.sync`
  instruction, a `readfirstlane` ballot fold on AMD, and a shuffle-based
  emulation on Apple Silicon GPUs.
