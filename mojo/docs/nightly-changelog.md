title: Mojo nightly
---

This version is still a work in progress.

## Highlights

- Code that performs many implicit conversions, most visibly large collection
  literals, compiles faster: the compiler no longer runs parameter inference on
  constructors that cannot be used for an implicit conversion in the first
  place. Files that are mostly data, such as the standard library's Unicode
  lookup tables, compile about 1.3x faster.

## Language enhancements

## Language changes

- The module & package system:

  - Directories may now have "namespace" semantics; a single directory name may
    resolve across distinct locations on disk which share that name.

    ```mojo
    # .
    # ├── one
    # │   └── foo
    # │       └── bar.mojo
    # └── two
    #     └── foo
    #         └── baz.mojo
    #
    # Compiles with -Ione -Itwo
    import foo.bar
    import foo.baz
    ```

## Library stabilizations

## Library changes

## GPU programming

## Tooling changes

## Removed

- Removed the `std.gpu.profiler` module and its `ProfileBlock` context manager.
  It timed host wall-clock, not GPU work, and reported the elapsed time with the
  operands reversed. Time a block of host code with
  [`perf_counter_ns()`](/docs/std/time/time/perf_counter_ns/) directly, and use
  a GPU profiler such as Nsight Systems or `rocprof` for device timings.

## Fixed
